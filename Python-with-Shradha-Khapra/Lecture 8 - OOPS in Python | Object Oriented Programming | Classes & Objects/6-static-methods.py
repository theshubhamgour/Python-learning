# *Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to
# extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without
# permanently modifying it



# Abstraction
# Hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the essential features to the user.


# Encapsulation
# Wrapping data and functions into a single unit (object).
