# Operators in Python are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Here are some common types of operators:
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 5
print("Addition:", a + b)          # Addition
print("Subtraction:", a - b)       # Subtraction
print("Multiplication:", a * b)    # Multiplication
print("Division:", a / b)          # Division
print("Modulus:", a % b)           # Modulus
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)   # Exponentiation
print("Floor Division:", a // b)   # Floor Division

# Comparison Operators
print("Equal:", a == b)            # Equal
print("Not Equal:", a != b)        # Not Equal
print("Greater Than:", a > b)      # Greater Than
print("Less Than:", a < b)         # Less Than
print("Greater Than or Equal To:", a >= b)  # Greater Than or Equal To
print("Less Than or Equal To:", a <= b)     # Less Than or Equal To

# Logical Operators
x = True
y = False
print("Logical AND:", x and y)     # Logical AND
print("Logical OR:", x or y)       # Logical OR
print("Logical NOT:", not x)       # Logical NOT

# Relational Operators
print("Is a greater than b?", a > b)   # Greater Than
print("Is a less than b?", a < b)      # Less Than
print("Is a equal to b?", a == b)      # Equal To   

#Assignment Operators
c = 10
print("Initial value of c:", c)
c += 5
print("After c += 5:", c)
c -= 3
print("After c -= 3:", c)
