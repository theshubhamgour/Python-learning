# Variables : Containers for storing data values
# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them.

name = "Shubham"  # String variable
age = 25          # Integer variable
height = 5.9      # Float variable
is_student = True # Boolean variable

# You can print the variables to see their values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
